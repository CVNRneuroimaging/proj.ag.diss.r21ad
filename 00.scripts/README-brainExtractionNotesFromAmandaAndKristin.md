On 20140408 Kristin and Amanda emailed me their brain extraction notes:

```
S01_rescan: tiny bit of the frontal lobe missing, warp good
S02: tiny bit of frontal lobe missing, warp good
S03_rescan: tiny bit of frontal lobe missing, warp good
S05: missed a little bit of parietal lobe bilaterally (questionable), warp good
S08: perfect skull strip and warp
S101: a little bit of the top of the brain is missing bilaterally, warp good
S104: tiny bit of frontal lobes missing, warp is questionable but probably ok
S107: little bit missing in frontal, parietal, and superior brain regions, warp good
S108: little bit of frontal lobe missing, warp is bad in the posterior region
S109: little bit of frontal lobe missing, warp good
S110: skull strip perfect, warp good
S112: little bit of frontal lobe missing, warp good on internal structures but not good in frontal and par
S113: little bit missing in frontal and parietal and superior regions, warp good on internal structures and missing some in frontal region
S115: missed a lot in the frontal lobe, warp good everywhere but the frontal lobes
S118: missing little bit of inferior frontal lobe, warp good everywhere but frontal where skull strip was missing
S11: skull strip good, warp good on internal structures but doesn't align well with parietal
S123: skull strip good, warp is good with internal structures but horrible cortically
S12: skull strip good, warp good
S13: t1 has ghosting, skull strip is good, warp good internally but missing some parietal
S14: skull strip is good, warp good internally but missing some superior cortex
S16: missing tiny bit of frontal, warp good internally but missing some parietal and frontal
S18: missing tiny bit of frontal, internal structures warped well but missing some frontal
S19: skull strip good, warp good internally but missing tiny bit of parietal
